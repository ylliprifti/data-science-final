# Final Capstone Project - Coursera Data Science

## How to use the software: 
---------------------------
1.) Verify the file "r-source/params.R" and set the correct parameters for folders and sample size

2.) Open and verify the file "final.R". Make sure the working directory is set correctly

3.) Run the file "final.R". It might take a while. It will produce 4 N-Grams and save them under the folder "samples". Also one large object called "result" will be left in the current workspece for exploration

4.) Run "shiny/server.R" and try the application.
